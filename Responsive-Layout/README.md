# Kenzie Academy Challenge: Responsive Layout

Follow the instructions provided on `my.kenzie.academy` for this challenge. The `style1.css` and `style2.css` files and the `src` folder are placeholders. Feel free to rename it or add additional files to the project. You are allowed to change any of the files **except the HTML file**. If you would like to use some JavaScript, you are more than welcome to, but it isn't necessary.

Customize this README.md however you want to turn it into documentation for your project (including deleting these opening paragraphs). The only required sections are the **Project Plan** and **Reflection** below. Be sure to use proper Markdown syntax in this file (here's a [cheatsheet PDF](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf) of the basic syntax).

## Project Plan (Advanced Level Only)

_(Put your project plan here. Explain the reasoning behind your design and your thought process from conception to implementation.)_

## Reflection (All Levels)

Why is it important that a website works well on a broad range of browsers and screen sizes?
 
As front-end developers, how do we make sure that pages work equally well across a variety of browsers and screen size?

_(Put your reflection answer here.)_

It's important that a website works well on a broad range of browsers and screen sizes because you need to keep the user in mind as a developer. You want to build applications that will be usable no matter what size/type of device it is being used on. As a front-end developer, you can make sure that your application works equally well across a variety of browswers and screen sizes by regularly testing your application. You can test on different browsers and use developer tools to inspect and debug the layout. Also just something as simple as regularly resizing your browser window while designing can be a big help. We can also use relative units instead of fixed units like pixels.
